Name: Controllability and Observability

a system is said to be controllable if an initial state x-not or x(t-not) can be transferred to a finite state x_y in a finite time interval  (t_f-t_0), t>=0 by some control u

state space eqn
x_ = Ax + Bu
y = Cx

x = state
x_ = derivative of state
y = output
A = system matrix
B = input Matrix (co-efficient)
u = 
C = output matrix
Rank = no. of non-zero rows/columns = linearly independent eqns


if each and every state of the system is controlled by input then the system s called completely controllable

How to check controllability?
a system is completely controllable if and only if the rank of the controllability matrix is equals to system matrix

controllability matrix = ?
[B AB A^2.B ... A^(n-1).B]

n = state variable`


if det(Controllable matrix) = 0 system is uncontrollable

Observable?
a system is said to be Observable if every state x_not can be exactly determined from the measurement of the output y over a finite time interval 
0<=t<=t_f

eqns,


Observability matrix,
.
[C_T : A_T.C_T : (A_T)^2.C_T : (A_T)^(n-1).C_T]

if output y can be achieved by each and every state in the system then the system will be called completely observable
